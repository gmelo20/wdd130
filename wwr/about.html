        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>🛶 OUR STORY</p>
        <p>Founded in 1998, Whitewater Rafting Co. began with a simple dream: to share the thrill of river adventures with people from all walks of life. What started as a small group of passionate guides and a few rafts on a single river has grown into one of the region’s most trusted and beloved whitewater companies.</p> 
        <p>Over the past 25+ years, we've guided thousands of rafters—families, thrill-seekers, school groups, and corporate teams—through breathtaking canyons and rushing rapids. Our reputation was built on safety, authenticity, and unforgettable experiences.</p>
        <p>Today, we remain just as passionate about the river as we were on day one. And we continue to grow, not just as a company, but as a community of adventurers who believe in the power of water, teamwork, and wild places.</p>
